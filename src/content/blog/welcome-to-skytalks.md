We're excited to launch the unofficial SKYTALKS demo blog! This will be our home for sharing news, updates, and insights from our community.

## What to Expect

- **CFP and Volunteers** &mdash; Get Call For Presentations and volunteer request updates.

## RSS Is Dead. Long Live RSS! 

Dust of your feed-readers and enjoy a more privacy-respecting way to get your updates. 

**Feed URI**: [{{siteUrl}}/feed]({{siteUrl}}/feed)


## Our Commitment

As always, we remain committed to our core principles:

> No recording. No photography. No bullshit.

While this blog is public, the talks themselves remain private. We'll share what we can without compromising the safe space we've created for candid discussions.

## Stay Connected

Follow along here for the latest updates. We're excited to have you as part of the SKYTALKS community!
